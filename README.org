#+title: Org-Mode Notebook Indexer

An interactive, web based index for your org-mode notes and articles.

The index presents all note entries chronologically. Each entry is tagged (using the file-tags defined in the org document) and timestamped, which allows the index to be filtered. The contents of an entry can be viewed in-line by clicking the heading.

* Prerequisites
- A webserver
- Emacs with Org-Mode (tested with Emacs 29.1, Org-Mode 9.6.6)
* Repository
Four components make up the indexing system;
- =./setup.el=, an elisp script that sets the org-publish configuration and defines some custom functions to modify the publishing backend
- =./templates/=, index templates (used by the custom functions defined in =setup.el=)
- =./static/style.css=, style sheet for index and published org mode content
- =./static/*.js=, javascript for interactive filtering and in-line display of content
* Setup
The org-mode documents to be published must be held under some parent directory. The file structure under this parent is arbitrary; All org-mode content under the parent directory, including nested documents, will be published to the index.

The presention of note entries in the index is always flat and sorted cronologically -- it does not reflect how the notes are organised in the file system. Since entries in the index are filtered using tags, it is not necessary to reflect how the notes are filed. This allows you the freedom to organise your notes on the filesystem in any way you want.

** Basic configuration
Configuration is set in the =org-publish-project-alist= variable at the bottom of =./setup.el=.

1) Modify the =:base-directory= property under the =media= and =org= lists with the path to your org-mode parent directory.
2) By default, the site will be published to =./published=. To change the publishing directory, simply change the paths for the =:publishing-directory= property under all lists. Note that the static content must be published to a subdirectory called 'static' (if this is changed, you must edit the template in =./templates/index.org=
3) To change the index title, modify the =:sitemap-title= property in the =org= list. The default is 'Project Journal'
4) Execute =setup.el=, i.e. =M-x load-file= then enter the path to =setup.el=.
5) Place =(load <repository-path>/setup.el)= in your =.emacs.d= to load the setup everytime emacs is launched

* Workflow
** Adding a New Note
1) Add a new org document at any position under the parent directory (specified in step 1 above). Give it any arbitrary name.
2) Open the document and give it a title and a list of tags, i.e.
#+begin_example
  ,#+title: New Document
  ,#+filetags: :foo:bar:
#+end_example

Ensure all media referenced by the document is filed somewhere under the parent directory.
** Publishing
1) Ensure =./setup.el= has been executed (see step 4/5 above)
2) Run =M-x org-publish= then enter =org-notebook-site=
3) Copy the contents of =./published= to your webserver
4) Navigate a browser to =<your-server>/published/index.html=

* Gallery
The documents under =./examples= produce the following output when published
